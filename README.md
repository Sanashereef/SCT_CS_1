# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Tool 🔐

This project is developed as part of **Task 1** for the **Cyber Security Internship by SkillCraft Technology**.

## 📌 Task Objective
Implement a simple **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption system using Python. The tool allows the user to:
- Encrypt a plaintext message by shifting characters
- Decrypt a ciphertext back to the original message using the same key

## 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a classical encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet.

For example:
- Plaintext: `HELLO`
- Key: `3`
- Ciphertext: `KHOOR`

## 🛠️ Features
- Simple and interactive user interface (Command Line or GUI)
- Supports both encryption and decryption
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters (optional)

## 🚀 How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.x

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SCT_CS_Task1.git
   cd SCT_CS_Task1
